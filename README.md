Web Application Security Assessment Report
📌 Project Overview
This project documents the process of conducting security testing on a sample web application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. The assessment follows ethical hacking principles and focuses on OWASP Top 10 risks.

🎯 Objective
Perform vulnerability scanning and manual testing.

Identify and document vulnerabilities.

Provide proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploitation.

Suggest mitigation measures to improve application security.

🛠 Tools Used
Burp Suite – Manual testing & interception

OWASP ZAP – Automated vulnerability scanning

SQLMap – SQL Injection detection & exploitation

Browser Developer Tools – Manual payload testing

📂 Methodology
Reconnaissance – Information gathering about the target.

Scanning & Enumeration – Identifying open endpoints and parameters.

Vulnerability Detection – Using OWASP ZAP & manual testing.

Exploitation – Proof-of-concept attacks to confirm vulnerabilities.

Reporting – Documenting vulnerabilities, severity, and remediation.

🔍 Vulnerability Summary
Vulnerability Type	Affected URL	Severity	OWASP Top 10 Category
Reflected XSS	/search.php?test=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E	High	A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
SQL Injection	Example URL Here	Critical	A03:2021 – Injection
Other Issues	Example URL Here	Medium	Relevant Category

🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC) – XSS
Request:

perl
Copy
Edit
GET /search.php?test=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1
Host: testphp.vulnweb.com
Impact: Executes JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to potential credential theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

🛡 Mitigation Recommendations
Implement input validation and output encoding.

Use parameterized queries for SQL statements.

Enable Content Security Policy (CSP).

Sanitize user inputs before rendering on the page.
